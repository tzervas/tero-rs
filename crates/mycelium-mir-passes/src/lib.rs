//! `mycelium-mir-passes` — the RC-annotated IR and reference-counting lowering passes (MEM-4).
//!
//! Implements the **MEM-4** leg of the DN-32 three-layer memory model: the static
//! uniqueness-analysis / Perceus-style reference-counting passes that DN-33 ratified (status
//! **Accepted**, §8.1). This crate is **optimisation-only and OUTSIDE the trusted Core IR** (KC-3 /
//! DN-33 §8.1 Q2): it *consumes* `mycelium_core::Node` read-only and produces a **separate**
//! RC-annotated IR ([`rc_ir::RcNode`]); the audited kernel (`mycelium-core`) does not grow, and a
//! bug here is a missed optimisation, never unsafety — the runtime `RcCell` probe
//! (`mycelium-std-runtime::rc`) remains the sound fallback (DN-33 §2).
//!
//! # What is built (MEM-4·B0 — the RC-emission pipeline foundation)
//!
//! The investigation recorded in DN-33 §6.1 found MEM-4 had *no input to operate on*: nothing
//! emitted RC ops, so there was nothing to elide. This crate supplies that foundation:
//!
//! - [`rc_ir`] — the **RC-annotated IR** `RcNode` (a mirror of the Core IR first-order fragment plus
//!   `Dup`/`Drop` wrappers and a per-binding own/borrow [`rc_ir::Mode`]).
//! - [`emit`] — the **naive (fully-owned) RC-emission** lowering `Node → RcNode`: a binding used `k`
//!   times gets `k-1` `Dup`s and each use consumes one; an unused binding gets one `Drop`. Recursion
//!   (`Fix`/`FixGroup`) is refused explicitly (G2 — never-silent).
//! - [`balance`] — the **structural balance invariant** (`1 + dups == uses + drops` per owned
//!   binding), verified independently over the emitted IR: the structural-invariant half of the
//!   ratified Q3 soundness strategy (DN-33 §8.1).
//!
//! # MEM-4 Increment 1 — non-escaping borrow elision (now built)
//!
//! - [`emit::emit_elided`] — borrow elision: a **fully-borrowable** `let` binding (every use is a
//!   reader-primitive read — `Op`/`Swap` argument — so the value never escapes) is emitted with its
//!   uses as [`rc_ir::RcNode::Borrow`] (non-consuming), **no** `Dup`, and a single
//!   [`rc_ir::RcNode::DropAfter`] reclaiming it after its reads. Strictly fewer RC ops than the naive
//!   owned emission (`k-1` `Dup`s → `0`), and semantics-preserving. Conservative + intraprocedural:
//!   any escaping use keeps the binding fully owned; `Lam` params stay `Owned` (interprocedural
//!   borrowing is a later increment).
//! - [`eval`] — the **reference RC-evaluator** + [`eval::differential`]: the differential half of the
//!   ratified Q3 soundness strategy. It runs a term's owned and elided emissions through an abstract
//!   RC machine and checks they reclaim the **same multiset of values** with **no use-after-free**,
//!   while the `Dup` count strictly drops. Together with the structural balance invariant
//!   ([`balance`]) this is the full Q3 check.
//!
//! # MEM-4 Increment 2 — `rc == 1` reuse annotation (now built)
//!
//! - [`emit::emit_reuse`] — a superset of [`emit::emit_elided`]: a `let` binding that is a
//!   **sole-owned single move** ([`emit::is_sole_owned_move`] — used exactly once, in a move
//!   position) has that move emitted as [`rc_ir::RcNode::MoveUnique`], recording that the runtime
//!   `UniqueOwner` branch is statically guaranteed (FBIP-reuse-eligible). The annotation's soundness
//!   is **machine-verified** by [`eval`]: it errors ([`eval::RcError::UnsoundUnique`]) if any
//!   `MoveUnique` is reached at a reference count other than 1. ~`Empirical`.
//!
//! # What is next (later increments)
//!
//! Increment 3 (full FIP static guarantee, Phase 3); the FBIP reuse-token *threading* (matching a
//! `MoveUnique` to a downstream same-shape allocation to recycle the cell); multi-move last-consume
//! annotation; interprocedural borrowing (`Mode::Borrowed` at call boundaries); recursion
//! (`Fix`/`FixGroup`).
//!
//! # Guarantee posture (VR-5)
//!
//! The emission's **balance property** is `Exact` (by construction, independently checked). No
//! performance claim is made — B0 deliberately emits the *most* RC ops; Increment 1 removes the
//! redundant ones, and any `dup`/`drop`-reduction figure stays `Declared` until measured on a
//! corpus (DN-33 §8.1 Q5; the *count* is `Exact`, read off the IR).
//!
//! Design: `docs/notes/DN-33-Layer1-Static-Uniqueness-Analysis.md`; task E12 / MEM-4.
