//! The never-silent bound: every top-level Rust item is either emitted, gapped, or both — never

//! **Guarantee: `Empirical/Declared`, not `Proven`.** `syn::Item` is `#[non_exhaustive]`, so
//! `dispatch_item`'s exhaustiveness rests on a trailing catch-all `_` arm the compiler does not
//! (and cannot) verify covers every real-world construct — there is no compiler-checked
//! exhaustiveness proof here, only a corpus of cases run through the driver and checked. This is
//! consistent with the crate-level guarantee tags (`src/lib.rs`); this property is checked over a
//! **fixed, hand-written corpus**, not proptest-generated arbitrary Rust source: generating
//! *syntactically valid* Rust via a `proptest::Strategy` is disproportionately fiddly for a PoC
//! (the grammar is context-sensitive enough that most naive token-soup strategies would just fail
//! to parse), so — as the kickoff brief explicitly allows — this is "a property over cases" via
//! `proptest::prop_oneof`/indexed selection over a fixed corpus, not over freely-generated input.
