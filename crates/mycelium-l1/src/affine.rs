//! The static affine **use-once** tracker for `Substrate` bindings (M-903; DN-71 Model S §4.2).
//!
//! `Substrate{tag}` is the affine external-resource kind (RFC-0006 LR-8): a binding of that type
//! must be **moved at most once along any control path** (DN-71 §4.2). A *move* is any reference to
//! the binding — `consume`, an argument pass, a return, a constructor/field capture — since this
//! language has no borrow/reference concept: every value use is a move (RT1). This module tracks
//! exactly that, indexed against the type-checker's own lexical `scope: Vec<(String, Ty)>`.
//!
//! # Design — piggybacked on the checker's existing scope, not a parallel pass
//! DN-71 §4.2 directs this be *"built on the checker's existing linearity machinery
//! (`check_linear` precedent), not a parallel analysis"* (DRY/KC-3). [`Tracker`] mirrors
//! [`crate::checkty::Cx`]'s `scope: Vec<(String, Ty)>` **by index**, not by name — a shadowing
//! rebinding of the same name is a fresh, independently-tracked slot, exactly as `scope` itself
//! treats shadowing ("a lexical stack; shadowing = later wins"). Every `scope.push`/`pop`/
//! `truncate` call site in `checkty.rs` pairs a matching [`Tracker`] call, so the two stacks always
//! have equal length and the same index always names the same binding in both.
//!
//! A [`Tracker`] is constructed **inert** ([`Tracker::inert`]) for exactly one `Cx` context that is
//! not a whole-function-body check — `infer_type` (the elaborator's **post-check** re-inference over
//! an already-validated term, RFC-0011, invoked repeatedly over partial/overlapping fragments with a
//! scope the elaborator threads itself — running the affine pass again there could false-positive on
//! a fragment that is not the whole original walk). `check_fn_body`'s `Cx` — the one full walk of one
//! function body from its parameter scope — gets an **active** tracker ([`Tracker::seeded`]) seeded
//! from the function's parameters. `check_lower_rule_rhs_type` (a `lower` rule's RHS check, DN-54
//! §4.1) **also** gets an active tracker (M-919; DN-71 Model S), seeded from an *empty* initial scope
//! — a `lower` rule has no value *parameters*, but its RHS can still legally introduce a
//! `Substrate`-typed local via a call to an already-checked helper `fn` (DN-54 §3.3 permits ordinary
//! fn calls in a rule's RHS), so an inert tracker there would have silently exempted every such
//! binding from the same double-consume check an ordinary function body gets — a real coverage gap
//! closed by M-919. Every push/pop/truncate/use hook on an inert tracker is a guaranteed no-op
//! (never a silent behavior change to the one remaining non-affine context — G2).
//!
//! # Branch merging — conservative union, sound over precise (`Empirical`, not `Proven`)
//! `if`/`match` alternatives are mutually exclusive at runtime, so each is checked from the **same**
//! pre-branch snapshot ([`Tracker::snapshot`] / [`Tracker::restore`]); the states after each
//! alternative are then combined as the **union** of "moved" outcomes
//! ([`Tracker::merge_alt`]/[`union_merge_into`]) — a slot moved in *any* alternative is treated as
//! moved going forward. This can reject a handful of programs a fully path-sensitive analysis would
//! accept (e.g. consuming a handle in only one arm, with no further use afterward, is still fine —
//! the merge only bites when a *later* reference exists), but it can **never** let a real
//! double-consume slip through undetected: VR-5 — sound over precise for v0.
//!
//! # A known, honest limitation — loop/closure bodies run a statically-unknown number of times
//! A `for` body and a `lambda` body are each checked **once**, lexically, but may *execute* zero,
//! one, or many times at runtime (a `for` iterates its spine; a closure may be called repeatedly).
//! A `Substrate` reference inside such a body is tracked as **one** lexical use — sound only when
//! that body in fact runs at most once. This is a real gap in the *static* pass for v0 (not silently
//! hidden — recorded here), and it is exactly why DN-71 §4.2 keeps the **runtime consumed-flag
//! backstop** ([`crate::substrate::SubstrateHandle::try_consume`]) as more than defense in depth: a
//! double-consume that escapes this lexical approximation still traps, never silently, at the first
//! repeated move. Closing this gap statically (an effect/multiplicity system over closures and
//! `for`) is future work, not required for the `Empirical` guarantee this pass ships at.
