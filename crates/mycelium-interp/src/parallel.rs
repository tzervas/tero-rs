//! Parallel evaluation of **provably-pure** (effect-free) Core IR fragments (M-862; RFC-0008 §4.2;
//! ADR-034; DN-25). This is a **perf path**, validated against the sequential reference by a
//! differential — never a second semantics: [`Interpreter::eval_core`]/[`Interpreter::step`] stay
//! the trusted, small-step meaning of a program (RFC-0008 §4.2, mirroring the AOT path's
//! relationship to the interpreter, KC-3 — concurrency adds *scheduling*, never new *meaning*).
//!
//! # What gets parallelized — the **bounded, top-level-only** plan ([`plan_parallel`])
//! Only the **outermost independent-argument batch** of a pure fragment is fanned out: the direct
//! argument list of a top-level [`Node::Op`] or [`Node::Construct`] (the "independent pure Construct
//! elements" the M-862 issue names). Each of those arguments is then evaluated **sequentially,
//! wholly inside its own worker**, by the trusted small-step interpreter ([`Interpreter::step`]) —
//! with **no nested** [`Scheduler::run_indexed`]. Everything else (a `Let`/`Match`/`App`/`Fix` head,
//! or an `Op`/`Construct` with fewer than two arguments) is evaluated **wholly sequentially** through
//! the trusted [`Interpreter::eval_core`]. The selection is reified in [`ParallelPlan`] — explicit
//! and EXPLAIN-able, never a silent reorder (house rule #2 / G2).
//!
//! **Why top-level only (interim bound, VR-5/G2).** The relocated M-709/M-861 [`Scheduler`]
//! ([`mycelium_sched`]) spawns **fresh OS threads per [`Scheduler::run_indexed`] call** (the
//! persistent, bounded work-stealing pool is a deferred follow-up). Fanning parallelism *recursively*
//! at every `Op`/`Construct`/`App` node would therefore spawn `O(depth × fan-out)` OS threads — a
//! resource-exhaustion hazard, not a correctness one, but real. Bounding the fan-out to the single
//! outermost batch caps total spawned threads at that batch's width, which is safe and predictable.
//! **This is an explicit interim measure**; once the pooled scheduler lands, the bound can widen
//! (the differential/EXPLAIN contract here is unaffected by *how much* is parallelized).
//!
//! # The purity gate ([`is_pure`])
//! [`is_pure`] is a **whole-fragment, structural** (syntactic) predicate, deliberately conservative
//! and all-or-nothing: if *any* subterm is not provably effect-free, the *whole* fragment is
//! evaluated by the ordinary sequential [`Interpreter::eval_core`] — never a partial/mixed order.
//! Grounding for "provably pure":
//! - Every built-in [`crate::prims::PrimFn`] is documented pure ([`crate::prims`] module docs) —
//!   **except** the reserved `wild:`-namespaced host-capability escape hatch (RFC-0028 §4.3), the
//!   *only* place a `Node::Op` reaches an arbitrary, potentially-effectful host operation. `is_pure`
//!   therefore excludes any `Op` whose `prim` starts with `"wild:"`.
//! - [`Node::Swap`] delegates to a runtime-supplied `Box<dyn SwapEngine>` (crate::swap) whose
//!   concrete behaviour cannot be statically inspected from a `Node` alone. `is_pure` conservatively
//!   treats **every** `Swap` node as an opacity boundary — never assumed pure, even though the
//!   shipped [`crate::swap::IdentitySwapEngine`] happens to be.
//! - `Const`/`Var`/`Lam` are trivially pure (no reduction).
//!
//! # Tag: Empirical (differential-checked)
//! The equivalence `eval_core_parallel(e) == eval_core(e)` for `e` in the pure fragment is checked by
//! a corpus differential (`src/tests/parallel.rs`), not proven — tagged **Empirical** on the
//! transparency lattice (never upgraded to `Proven` without a checked side-condition, VR-5).
